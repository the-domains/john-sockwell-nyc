I finally received my beta invitation the to The Grid, the artificial intelligence web designer. I hope this new platform encourages me to create more by removing any frustration over design.

From what I understand, The Grid isn't what I would call an AI, but more a set of programatic design principals that are applied to a site's content. The Grid employs a team of designers, but instead of designing sites, they codify design principals that the The Grid's computers applies. As design trends and styles change, I imagine so to will The Grid's algorithms.

The Grid's sites seem to be hosted on github.com so there must be some GitHub Pages / Jekyll integration. It's a pretty clever approach: GitHub provides the hosting for free, the changing of layouts and templates can live within version control, and Jekyll's use of Markdown files separates the content from the layout -- critical if The Grid truly redesigns the site every time content changes .

I'll post a followup once I've created and migrated some additional content over.
