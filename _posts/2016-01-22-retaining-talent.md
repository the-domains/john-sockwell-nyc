Finding great talent is the most challenging part of my job. The list of skills I'm looking for is not long, but the people I want aren't interested in agencies. Agencies are grueling and the context switching our digital teams face disrupt the product team's ability to grock a problem. Everyone on my team is seeking the "aha" rush and can get really worn down when things get in the way.
